# Breadboarding Proof-of-Concept in Angular 9

by [Ben Nadel][bennadel]

**[Run the Breadboarding Demo](https://breadboarding-poc.netlify.com)** &raquo;

This is a proof-of-concept (POC) for a Breadboading workflow as outlined in the book [Shape Up by Ryan Singer][blog-3687]. I really liked this idea; and I felt like it could be a value-add for [InVision App][invision] - especially for non-designers who want to quickly outline how something should work. As such, I wanted to put this POC together so that I could demonstrate the idea to my Product team.

This POC is very rough. I am not even sure I like the routing scheme. But, it works enough to get the point across. It currently stores data in `localStorage` so that it can be used across page refreshes.
